All Servers,Modify Local Server Firewall,"Posit products are often blocked by local server firewalls, most organizations do not rely on local firewalls for server security. If your organization controls access to this server with an external firewall, we recommend disabling the local firewall. If your organization requires the local server firewall to be enabled, please see the list of necessary ports to allow in the list.",[Docs](https://docs.posit.co/networking/),all,
All Servers,Disable SELinux,"SELinux is often enabled by default on Redhat Linux distributions.
